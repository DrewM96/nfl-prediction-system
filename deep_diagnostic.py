üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

Your model is predicting IND -8.7 when Vegas says IND -7.0.
The 15.7 point discrepancy between your model and Vegas suggests:

1. ‚úÖ DATA IS CORRECT
   - IND: 30.8 ppg scored, 20.8 allowed (+10.0 diff)
   - ARI: 20.5 ppg scored, 18.5 allowed (+2.0 diff)
   - These match actual 2025 performance

2. ‚ùå MODELING APPROACH IS FLAWED
   - Your power rating calculation over-estimates spread impact
   - Rating diff of 10.3 ‚Üí spread of 8.7 is TOO HIGH
   - Should be: rating diff of 10.3 ‚Üí spread of ~6.2
   - Then add 2.5 home field = 8.7 total (still high)

3. üéØ THE REAL ISSUE: COEFFICIENT CALIBRATION
   - You're using: rating_diff √ó 0.6 = spread contribution
   - Should be: rating_diff √ó 0.4 = spread contribution
   - Example: 10.3 rating diff √ó 0.4 = 4.1 points
   - Add 2.5 home field = 6.6 point spread
   - Much closer to Vegas -7.0!

4. üí° ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION:
   - Vegas knows something you don't (injury, weather, etc.)
   - But 1.7 point difference is actually ACCEPTABLE
   - Models within 2-3 points of Vegas are considered good

RECOMMENDATION:
- Change coefficient from 0.6 to 0.4 in spread calculation
- Accept that 2-3 point differences from Vegas are normal
- Use model to identify outliers (5+ point differences)
- For betting, always check injury reports and news

In corrected_ratings.py, change line:
