üéØ How to Use These Predictions for Betting:

1. WHEN MODEL MATCHES VEGAS (within 2.5 points):
   ‚úÖ Model validates Vegas line
   ‚Üí Look elsewhere for value
   
2. WHEN MODEL DIFFERS BY 2.5-4.5 POINTS:
   ü§î Potential value opportunity
   ‚Üí Check injury reports
   ‚Üí Check weather
   ‚Üí Consider betting if you trust your model
   
3. WHEN MODEL DIFFERS BY 4.5+ POINTS:
   üö® Major discrepancy
   ‚Üí Something is wrong (injury, news, public betting)
   ‚Üí Research heavily before betting
   ‚Üí Usually means you're missing key info

4. BEST USE CASE:
   üìä Use model to FIND games to research
   ‚Üí Model says IND -10, Vegas says IND -7
   ‚Üí Ask: "Why does Vegas think it's closer?"
   ‚Üí Check: Injuries? Weather? Public betting?
   ‚Üí Make INFORMED decision

REMEMBER: Vegas employs professionals and has more data.
Use your model as ONE tool, not the only tool.
